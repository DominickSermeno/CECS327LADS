# CECS327LADS
Workspace for Projects 6 and 7 of CECS 327

"Client-server programming with TCP stream socket.

Primarily, this assignment is the server side of Assignment #6. That is, implement a stateful & concurrent server that calculates (& sends reply to its client) one of 3 values: nextEvenFib, nextLargerRand, nextPrime (also see server below). Moreover, implement a basic client software that sends requests & outputs 5 nextEvenFib values, then 5 requests for nextLargerRand, finally 5 requests for nextPrime, to test your server.

The program is to be completed by a team of 3 or 4 students. Two machines will be needed in the demo of this assignment. One is running the server and one is running several instances of the client software.

Submit hard copy of your properly documented code, including the software description, for your team." 

Tasks: 
Alan: Sever side connection
